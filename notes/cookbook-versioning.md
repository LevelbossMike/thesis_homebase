Cookbook Versioning and Tracking
================================

@temujin9 please complete and correct

* git tag labels the *release* of a cookbook version: tag 'cookbooks-elasticsearch-3.1.7' denotes the *last* commit to that tag.
* The next commit will be the one that bumps the version number: the `metadata.rb` will then read '3.1.8'.

Periodically, we will release a 'gold' version set and push those to the opscode cookbook community site.
