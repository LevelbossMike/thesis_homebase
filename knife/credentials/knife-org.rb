  # Change `NAME_FOR_AMI` to a helpful identifier. For example, our standard
  # Ubuntu 11.04 AMI is `ironfan-natty`: it has lines for each permutation of
  # bit and backing we use:
  #
  #    %w[us-east-1  64-bit  ebs       ironfan-natty ] => { :image_id => 'ami-12345678', :ssh_user => 'ubuntu', :bootstrap_distro => "ubuntu11.04-ironfan", },
  #    %w[us-east-1  32-bit  ebs       ironfan-natty ] => { :image_id => 'ami-acbdef01', :ssh_user => 'ubuntu', :bootstrap_distro => "ubuntu11.04-ironfan", },
  #    %w[us-east-1  64-bit  instance  ironfan-natty ] => { :image_id => 'ami-98765432', :ssh_user => 'ubuntu', :bootstrap_distro => "ubuntu11.04-ironfan", },

  #
  # Then a typical cluster definition file might specify
  #
  #   cloud do
  #     image              'ironfan-natty'
  #     flavor             'c1.xlarge'

  #     # ...
